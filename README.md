Learning node.js with small projects

STEPS->

When you click add button, the webpage (the frontend) sends your task to the server.
The server takes that task and writes it down in a special file called tasks.json.
After saving your new task in tasks.json, the server says, "Okay, I saved it! Here is the updated list of all your tasks."
This is like the server giving the browser a list of all tasks so the browser knows everything youâ€™ve added.

Now that the browser has the updated list of tasks (including the one you just added), it takes that list and shows it on the webpage.
It updates the screen, so you can see your list of tasks, including your new one.
